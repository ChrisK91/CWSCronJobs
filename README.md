CWSCronJobs
==========

Sometimes it is necessary to perform scheduled actions with your CubeWorld sever. CWSCronJobs is the tool for this job. Currently it can only restart your server at a scheduled time interval, but more functionality is planned ;)

You can either start the server normally or with *CWSCronJobs HOUR MINUTE* to restart daily at a certain time (e.g. *CWSCronJobs 15 01* to restart daily at 15:01). Please note, that the watcher has to be active to perform a restart of the server.
